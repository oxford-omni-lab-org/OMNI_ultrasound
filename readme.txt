This repository is currently still work in progress. Documentation can be found on: https://oxford-omni-lab-org.github.io/OMNI_ultrasound/

The alignment and read/write utility function are well-tested and can be used. 

The subcortical segmentation_model module should work, but more tests are required to verify all functionality. 
An initial version of Tedsnet is included, but this is not yet well-tested.

Keep in mind that no one has yet used the repo except for me, so make sure to properly inspect
your results so we can find any bugs and correct them. Any feedback on usability/documentation etc.,
is also very welcome!
